<p>Reproducer is an extension designed to help with simplifying and reproducing findings outside of Burp Suite.
    This can be used to provide information to developers, assist with creating proof of concepts,
    or develop custom fuzzing with, for example, Python.</p>

<p>Support for generating requests in the following formats (in addition to the built-in "Copy as curl command""):</p>
<ol>
    <li>JavaScript Fetch</li>
    <li>Powershell</li>
    <li>Python Requests</li>
</ol>

<p>The extension works by removing headers, parameters, and cookies and observing the response length and code compared to the original request.
    With this it is possible to tell which are required. You can then select which of the headers, parameters,
    and cookies you want to include in the final simplified request. Right-clicking in the "Analysis Results" table allows several options for auto including.</p>

<p>The headers, parameters, and cookies analysis can also assist with identifying which are required for a request to be authenticated.
    This can be used similar to the session analysis feature in the Paramalyzer extension but with header and parameter support as well.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Right-click a single request or multiple selected requests to open the context menu</li>
    <li>Select Extensions &gt; Reproducer</li>
    <li>Select Send to Reproducer</li>
</ol>
