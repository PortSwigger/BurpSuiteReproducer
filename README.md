You can look at the request and response with the header, cookie, or parameter removed by selecting the item in the "Analysis Results" table and then clicking the "Analyze" tab.

To generate the final simplified request you can select what to include or not include by selecting the checkbox for the item. There are also several useful functions to auto include based on status code or length in the right click context menu.

Once you are ready to test your simplified request you can click the "Create Simplified Request" button. This will remove the items that are not included and send the request. Results can be viewed in the "Simplified" request/response viewer tab.

You can then right-click on the simplified request and use the built-in "Copy to Curl" or use one of the "Reproduce in Other Tools" features.
